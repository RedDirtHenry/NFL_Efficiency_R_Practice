# NFL_Efficiency_R_Practice
To get better at R and do some fun stuff with NFL analytics, I'm trying to make new ways to measure position efficiency. 


# Wide Receiver Efficiency
Attempt to make a measure of Wide Receiver Efficiency
What makes a good wide receiver:
1 - Route Running & Separation
2 - Catching the football
3 - YAC
4 - Impact Plays (Converting 3rd downs, big plays (20+ yds), Red Zone and big play TD's)
(Credit to Tyler Brandt of PFF for the idea for some of the factors going into this)
